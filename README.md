Cell Shield is a service that allows backing a [shields.io][shio] badge with
a cell from a public Google Spreadsheet.

The value of the cell and the background color will come through. 

A label is suggested if the cell has a `:`, otherwise it is up to the user to set it.

You can override the color(s) and label with https://shields.io/endpoint and have a few more options.

## Usage
